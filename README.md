# Gondolin Agent Sandbox

**Local Linux micro-VMs with programmable network and filesystem control.**

AI agents increasingly run generated code without human review.  That code often
needs network access and credentials, which creates exfiltration risk.

Gondolin runs that code inside a fast local Linux micro-VM (QEMU by default,
with an optional experimental `krun` backend) while keeping network and
filesystem access under host-side policy control.  That policy layer can be
customized via JavaScript.

## Quick Example

```ts
import { VM, createHttpHooks } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const { httpHooks, env } = createHttpHooks({
  allowedHosts: ["api.github.com"],
  secrets: {
    GITHUB_TOKEN: {
      hosts: ["api.github.com"],
      value: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
    },
  },
});

const vm = await VM.create({ httpHooks, env });

// String form runs in /bin/sh -lc "..."
const result = await vm.exec(`
  curl -sS -f \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    https://api.github.com/user
`);

console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);

await vm.close();
```

The guest only sees a placeholder token. The real secret is injected by the
host only for allowed destinations (including `Authorization: Basic ...` flows).

## CLI Quick Start

```bash
npx @earendil-works/gondolin bash
```

Useful session commands:

```bash
# List running sessions
npx @earendil-works/gondolin list

# Attach to an existing session
npx @earendil-works/gondolin attach <session-id>

# Snapshot a running session (stops it)
npx @earendil-works/gondolin snapshot <session-id>

# Resume from snapshot id/path
npx @earendil-works/gondolin bash --resume <snapshot-id-or-path>
```

Guest assets (kernel/initramfs/rootfs plus optional krun boot artifacts,
~200MB+) are resolved automatically on first use via
`builtin-image-registry.json` and cached locally. When no image is specified,
Gondolin uses `GONDOLIN_DEFAULT_IMAGE` (default: `alpine-base:latest`).

Requirements:

| macOS                    | Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brew install qemu node` | `sudo apt install qemu-system-arm nodejs npm` |

Optional experimental libkrun backend setup:

```bash
make krun-runner
```

Published installs of `@earendil-works/gondolin` also include platform-specific
optional runner packages for supported targets.

This stages `libkrun` under `.cache/` (no global install) and builds the local
runner helper at `host/krun-runner/zig-out/bin/gondolin-krun-runner`.
On macOS, the build ad-hoc signs the runner with the
`com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement so Hypervisor.framework access is allowed.
When present, Gondolin auto-detects this runner for `--vmm krun`.

Linux prerequisites for `make krun-runner` (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt install \
  build-essential curl git make pkg-config clang lld xz-utils \
  libclang-dev llvm-dev libcap-ng-dev

# libkrun requires a modern Rust toolchain (edition2024)
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --profile minimal
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# install Zig 0.16.0 for your Linux architecture
```

When `vmm=krun` is selected, Gondolin requires krun boot assets from the selected
image manifest (`assets.krunKernel` and optional `assets.krunInitrd`).
For custom kernels/initrds, provide an explicit `sandbox.imagePath` asset object.

> Linux and macOS are supported. ARM64 is the most tested runtime path today.
> Linux x86_64 `make krun-runner` is covered by CI smoke builds.

## Feature Highlights

- **Local disposable micro-VMs** for agent turns/tasks
- **Programmable HTTP/TLS egress policy** (allowlists + request/response hooks)
- **Secret injection without guest exposure** via placeholders
- **Programmable VFS mounts** that allow you to write custom file system behavior in JavaScript.
- **Ingress gateway** to expose guest HTTP services on host (`--listen`, `vm.enableIngress()`)
- **Attaching** allows you to attach a shell to an already running VM
- **SSH support**
  - host -> guest access (`vm.enableSsh()`)
  - optional guest -> upstream allowlisted SSH egress (proxied, exec-oriented)
- **Disk checkpoints (snapshots)** with resume support
- **Custom image builds** (Alpine-based build pipeline, optional OCI rootfs source)
- **Configurable DNS behavior** (`synthetic`, `trusted`, `open`), rootfs modes (`readonly`, `memory`, `cow`), and runtime rootfs sizing
