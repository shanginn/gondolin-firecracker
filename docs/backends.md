# VM Backends: QEMU vs libkrun

Gondolin supports two VM backends:

- `qemu` (default, broader feature support)
- `krun` (experimental, uses `libkrun` via `host/krun-runner`)

This page is the authoritative backend-parity reference for SDK/CLI behavior.

## Architecture and Kernel Constraints

### QEMU

- Guest architecture must match the selected QEMU binary (`qemu-system-aarch64` vs `qemu-system-x86_64`)
- QEMU binary precedence: explicit `sandbox.qemuPath` → manifest-derived default when guest arch is known → host-arch default fallback
- CPU model precedence: explicit `sandbox.cpu` → `GONDOLIN_CPU` → backend-specific auto selection
- Kernel/initrd/rootfs come from selected guest assets

### krun

- Guest architecture must match the **host** architecture
- Requires a **libkrunfw-compatible kernel**
- Gondolin requires image manifest krun boot assets:
    - `assets.krunKernel`
    - `assets.krunInitrd` (optional; defaults to an empty initrd)
- Build/setup path: `gondolin build` (or published image assets)
- `make krun-runner` builds the runner binary; it does not provide kernel assets

Runner path resolution:

- Auto-detected from local `host/krun-runner/zig-out/bin/gondolin-krun-runner` when present
- Auto-detected from installed platform runner package when available (for example `@earendil-works/gondolin-krun-runner-darwin-arm64` or `@earendil-works/gondolin-krun-runner-linux-x64`)

## Runtime Caveats

- `krun` backend is still experimental and has less runtime parity coverage than `qemu`
- Cross-backend checkpoint resume (`qemu` ↔ `krun`) requires assets that include `manifest.assets.krunKernel`
- Some krun networking edge cases are still under investigation
- Host CA trust configuration can cause guest-visible HTTP `502` errors on both backends when upstream TLS validation fails

## Recommendation

Use `qemu` unless you specifically want to exercise the `krun` backend. If you expose backend knobs in higher-level tooling, gate them by backend and fail fast on unsupported combinations.
