## VFS Providers

Gondolin can mount host-backed paths into the guest via programmable VFS
providers.

See [VFS Providers](./vfs.md) for the full provider reference and common
recipes (blocking `/.env`, hiding `node_modules`, read-only mounts, hooks, and
more).

Minimal example:

```ts
import { VM, RealFSProvider, MemoryProvider } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  vfs: {
    mounts: {
      "/workspace": new RealFSProvider("/host/workspace"),
      "/scratch": new MemoryProvider(),
    },
  },
});
```

## Image Management

Guest images (kernel, initramfs, rootfs, and optional backend-specific boot
artifacts) are resolved automatically from local overrides/store first, then from
`builtin-image-registry.json` when needed.
The default cache location is `~/.cache/gondolin/images/`.

Override image selection / source:

```bash
# Use explicit local assets
export GONDOLIN_GUEST_DIR=/path/to/assets

# Change default image selector
export GONDOLIN_DEFAULT_IMAGE=alpine-base:1.0

# Override builtin registry URL
export GONDOLIN_IMAGE_REGISTRY_URL=https://example.invalid/my-registry.json
```

Build-id selectors (`uuid`) are resolved locally first and only downloaded from
the builtin registry when that registry has an explicit `builds[buildId]`
mapping.

Builtin registry entries are normalized: `refs[name:tag][arch]` stores a build
id, and `builds[buildId]` stores the downloadable source metadata (`url`,
optional `sha256`, optional `arch`).

Check asset status programmatically:

```ts
import {
  hasGuestAssets,
  ensureGuestAssets,
  getAssetDirectory,
} from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

console.log("Assets available:", hasGuestAssets());
console.log("Asset directory:", getAssetDirectory());

// Download if needed
const assets = await ensureGuestAssets();
console.log("Kernel:", assets.kernelPath);
```

To build custom images, see: [Building Custom Images](./custom-images.md).

Use custom assets programmatically by pointing `sandbox.imagePath` at the
asset directory:

```ts
import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const vm = await VM.create({
  sandbox: {
    imagePath: "./my-assets",
  },
});

const result = await vm.exec("uname -a");
console.log("exitCode:", result.exitCode);
console.log("stdout:\n", result.stdout);
console.log("stderr:\n", result.stderr);

await vm.close();
```

## Rootfs Modes

You can control rootfs write behavior per VM:

- `readonly`: rootfs is read-only (`EROFS` on writes)
- `memory`: writable throwaway rootfs
    - on `qemu`, this uses backend-native snapshot mode
    - on `krun`, this is **not RAM-backed**; Gondolin creates a temporary qcow2 overlay on disk and deletes it on close
    - on `firecracker`, this is **not RAM-backed**; Gondolin creates a temporary raw copy on disk and deletes it on close
- `cow`: writable qcow2 copy-on-write overlay (default for `qemu` and `krun`)
    - this does **not** write back into the original rootfs image
    - by default it is a throwaway image file that is deleted on close
    - on `qemu` and `krun`, it is a real qcow2 layer and can be checkpointed
    - on `firecracker`, it is a temporary raw copy and cannot be checkpointed yet

```ts
const vm = await VM.create({
  rootfs: { mode: "readonly" },
});
```

If the guest asset `manifest.json` contains `runtimeDefaults.rootfsMode`, that
value is used as the default when `rootfs.mode` is not provided. Without a
manifest default, Firecracker uses `readonly` by default to avoid a temporary raw
rootfs copy on startup.

## Runtime Rootfs Size

Use `rootfs.size` to ensure the effective root disk has at least the requested
size without rebuilding the base image:

```ts
const vm = await VM.create({
  rootfs: { size: "2G" },
});
```

Gondolin grows the writable root disk image on the host with `qemu-img resize`
(or direct raw-file truncation for Firecracker) and then runs
`resize2fs /dev/vda` in the guest before `VM.start()` completes. The base rootfs
image is not modified when using the default `cow` mode. When combined with
`rootfs.mode="memory"`, Gondolin uses a temporary writable image so the
guest-side filesystem resize survives for the lifetime of that VM.

The guest image must include `resize2fs` (Alpine package: `e2fsprogs`). Newer
`alpine-base` images include it; custom images should add it to
`alpine.rootfsPackages` when using `rootfs.size`.

## Disk Checkpoints (qcow2)

Gondolin supports **disk-only checkpoints** of the VM root filesystem.

A checkpoint captures the VM's writable disk state and can be resumed cheaply
using qcow2 backing files.

> **Backend support:** checkpoints work with both `qemu` and `krun`.
> Firecracker checkpoints are not supported yet.
> Resume enforces checkpoint backend-compatibility metadata.
> See [VM Backends](./backends.md).

See also: [Snapshots](./snapshots.md).

```ts
import path from "node:path";

import { VM } from "@earendil-works/gondolin";

const base = await VM.create();

// Install packages / write to the root filesystem...
await base.exec("apk add git");
await base.exec("echo hello > /etc/my-base-marker");

// Note: must be an absolute path
const checkpointPath = path.resolve("./dev-base.qcow2");
const checkpoint = await base.checkpoint(checkpointPath);

const task1 = await checkpoint.resume();
const task2 = await checkpoint.resume();

// Both VMs start from the same disk state and diverge independently
await task1.close();
await task2.close();

checkpoint.delete();
```

Notes:

- This is **disk-only** (no in-VM RAM/process restore)
- The checkpoint is a single `.qcow2` file; metadata is stored as a JSON trailer
  (reload with `VmCheckpoint.load(checkpointPath)`)
- Checkpoints require guest assets with a `manifest.json` that includes a
  deterministic `buildId` (older assets without `buildId` cannot be snapshotted)
- QEMU `rootfs.mode="memory"` uses backend snapshot mode and is not checkpointable
  unless combined with `rootfs.size`; use `rootfs.mode="cow"` when you need a
  writable qcow2 layer explicitly
- Cross-backend resume (`qemu` ↔ `krun`) requires guest assets with krun boot
  artifacts (`manifest.assets.krunKernel`)
- Firecracker writable rootfs modes use temporary raw copies and are not
  checkpointable yet
- Some guest paths are tmpfs-backed by design (eg. `/root`, `/tmp`, `/var/log`); writes under those paths are not part of disk checkpoints
